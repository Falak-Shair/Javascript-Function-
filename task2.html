    Q2): The current year and the year in which the employee joined the
    organization are entered through the keyboard. 
    If the number of years for which the employee has 
    served the organization is greater than 3 then a 
    bonus of Rs. 2500/- is given to the employee. 
    If the years of service are not greater than 3, 
    then the program should do nothing.

    <input type="text" name="" id="j_year" placeholder="year of joining">

            alert(bounuschk(c_year , j_year) );
