    Q14): AKD bought 600 shares of stock at a price of 21.77 per share. A year later he sold them for just 16.44 per share. Write a program that calculates and displays the following:
• The total amount paid for the stock.
• The total amount received from selling the stock.
• The total amount of money he lost.
• Percentage loss


    <script>

        var tot_shares = 600 ;         //total shares bought
        var per_buy = 21.77 ;           
        var per_sale = 16.44 ;


        var paid = tot_shares*per_buy ;          //total amount paid for stock
        var sell = tot_shares*per_sale ;         //total amount recieve for stock
        var loss = paid - sell ;                 //total amount he lost
        var per = (loss/paid)*100;               //percentage of loss

        console.log('total amount paid for stock: ' +paid);
        console.log('total amount recieve for stock: ' +sell);
        console.log('total amount he lost: ' +loss);
        console.log('percentage of loss: ' +per.toFixed(2))
